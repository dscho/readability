This is a copy of the Readability bookmarklet from Arc90 Labs:

I love the Readability bookmarklet, but they replaced it with a whole
web service at http://www.readability.com .. it redirects you to a
page on readability.com when you activate it instead of just modifying
the page you're viewing .. and they changed the font/color options a
little .. and it's a browser extension instead of a bookmarklet now,
and other things that make me like the new version less.

But the bookmarklet is open source! And has no non-static server-side
dependencies at all! So it still works perfectly!  Thanks, Arc90 Labs
people!
